A simulation program of a real-time vehicle loads monitoring and early warning system. Structural Health Monitoring System (SHMS).
 
Implemented in Pyhton 2.7.x

Nowadays a large amount of bridges are operating widely in China. In order to ensure the
performance and efficiency of the nation-wide highway transportation system, the demand of an
accurate and real-time monitoring system for bridgesâ€™ health is increasingly rising. The Structural
Health Monitoring System of bridges has become a considerable researching and engineering area
in the bridge industry.

The Structural Health Real-time Vehicle Load Monitoring and Early Warning System was
brought forward in the aspect of vehicle load effect, as to acquire the real-time information of
vehicle loads in advance, calculate and predict the structural effect in the background in advance,
and make warning to the potential dangers in time. The working process of the system was
explained by modules in detail. A real-time simulation program generating vehicle loads with
constant velocity, transporting the data flow, managing vehicle loads and calculating the real-time
structural dynamic effect, was made by Python using the Object Oriented Programming method.
The real-time dynamic data flow of vehicle loads and bridge effects was realized with the data
interfaces of loads. The safety assessment and in-time alert was available by using shared data
pools of effect. All function modules listed were gathered to run under a real-time multi-threaded
coordination. The concept of the system was primarily verified to be feasible and serviceable with
an application onto a 50-meter simple supported girder bridge.

Key words: Vehicle Load, Bridge, Health Monitoring, Early Warning, Real-time Operating System (RTOS), Multi-threaded Coordination
